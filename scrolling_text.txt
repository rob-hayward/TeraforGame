interesting interactions.


weak enough to give time for interactions,


drawn in by an inevitable gravity,


energetic repulsion from an overcharged body,


time and space simultaneously spewed forth,


at each point along an infinitely folded tesseract of fractal spectrum,


no meaning to any but a subject,


Unless, time, speed, scale are relative,


Impossible?


The loop grows exponentially in speed and scale at each level.


Unfathomable depths of imagination, visualisation, conceptualization,


Does a multiverse orbit?


Does a universe orbit a blackhole of universal proportions?


multi-galactic systems orbit supermassive black-holes.


galaxies orbit massive black-holes,


star systems orbit black-holes,


as planetary systems orbit stars,


relativity escapes you from impossible loops,


Each Sun is a god,

Now, build your planet!


'esc' to escape


'P' to pause

'A W S D' to create a positively charged force
